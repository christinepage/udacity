Your response goes here!

I have learned to use the MDN documentation and learned to use several html elements like ul, em, and sup.
The tree structure organization is easy to follow. The syntax is generally easy.
Sometimes finding the right element to do a job is a little difficult.
I have persevered even when my final direction seems unclear. I have searched documentation for clarification.
